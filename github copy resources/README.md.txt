GitHub Home Page Clone
Welcome to my first HTML project! I have created a clone of the GitHub Home Page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Description
This project is a replica of the GitHub Home Page as it appeared with my login. It showcases my skills in front-end web development and serves as a practice project to enhance my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
JavaScript is used here to show alerts and opening a web page which is common for all links in the project.

Features
HTML: Structure of the webpage
CSS: Styling and layout
JavaScript: Interactivity and dynamic content

I am open to any positive suggestions at my mail {kavanshdelhi@gmail.com}.
